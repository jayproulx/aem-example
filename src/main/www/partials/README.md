Partials
========

Partials are handy to use with AngularJS to simplify your HTML files.  Single page applications can quickly become bloated with HTML controls and initial load performance is a serious consideration for mobile development.  In general, users are happy to wait for small intervals, but a big delay while loading your application will cause them the most grief.
